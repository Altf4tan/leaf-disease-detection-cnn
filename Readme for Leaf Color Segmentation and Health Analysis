# Leaf Color Segmentation and Health Analysis

## Overview
This project applies color segmentation techniques to identify green and brown regions in leaf images, which can help indicate healthy and diseased areas. This can be useful for quick analysis of plant health based on color patterns.

## Features
- Converts leaf images from RGB to HSV color space for precise color detection
- Detects and isolates green (healthy) and brown (potentially diseased) areas
- Displays original and segmented images for analysis

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Getting Started

### Installation
Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/leaf-color-segmentation-health-analysis.git
